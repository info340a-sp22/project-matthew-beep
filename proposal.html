        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                As UW students, we have often run into the issue of not knowing where to get food around campus due to the myriad of choices, especially on the Ave. This may cause excessive time to be used on deciding and researching, and incline students to choose the food/place they usually go to. Our project is interested in improving the convenience of selecting a restaurant and easily exploring new ones. 
            </li>
            <li>
                There is no technology currently available that specifically helps individuals within the area to find new places to eat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                There are currently a few websites that we can use to find new eateries in the area such as Google and Yelp. While these options are well established, popular, and have large databases with restaurants in any area, they are not the best at helping students find new places in the area. They often show the same places every time you search for something to eat in the U district and only show the most popular ones. 
            </li>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                For our website, our primary users would be UW students, as they will be in close proximity to the Ave and all of the restaurants that are nearby. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Users would be interacting with restaurant pictures, locations, and user submitted “signature dishes/orders”. We are considering finding a way to pull data from Google Maps to determine restaurant locations, but they could also be user-submitted as well. Users would also be interacting with other users’ personal favorite restaurant lists and their recommended restaurants as well. 
            </li>
            <li>
                One of the first big interactions that users will be provided is a questionnaire. Users will be asked information relating to their desired location, their favorite types of food etc. Users then will be shown a host of restaurants that most fit these answers, from there users can choose to mark something as a place they have visited before or not. Adding said place to a list of visited locations. From that list, users can also make a favorites list, where users can add favorite restaurants sorted by location, type of food etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our project would improve convenience in a couple of ways. First and foremost, it would improve research on new places. Many websites have ranking of food places, but very few have the customization options that will be provided and almost none will be as consensus in terms of gathering the UW populace's opinion on a certain restaurant. It also will provide many niche restaurants that may not appear on some apps allowing for people to try new places more often as well.
